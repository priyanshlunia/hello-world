# hello-world
This is an example repository for PHYS 477.

My name is Priyansh and I'm a senior currently taking PHYS 477. Here I'm going to write a little bit about what Github is.
GitHub is an online platform for version control -- essentially, it has various features which makes tracking changes amongst an individual working on a project as well as whole teams working on a project extremely streamlined. This allows teams of people to colloborate in a very cohesive manner.
